## Milestone 1, Part III: Client Requirements

### Target Audience(s)

The users are engineer and marketing person. The most place they interact with the website would be the blog section.


### Purpose & Content

The purpose of the website is to tell people who we are and what we do.

### Needs and Wants

This website tells our customer or potential customer who we are and what our products can do. It also serve as an information center that user can find technical documents to help them use our products, and exchange ideas with engineers of our company and other users.

    * Search bar for technical documents
    * Information center

  * **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    * Chinese version of this website
    * Use google translate to auto-translate the site
  * **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    * Creating multiple pages manually would require manual skills, effort and time that we do not have.

### Hosting Plan


[What is your plan for hosting your client's website?]

We will host the website on Heroku.

### Client's Edits

**Yes** they will edit the site, we will send them our files so they can edit the code and content themselves.

## Milestone 2, Part II: Sketches, Navigation & Wireframes

### Sketches

[Insert your sketches here.]

### Navigation

[What will be your top-level pages and your sub-pages for those top-level pages? What will your website's navigational structure?]

[Tip: If you use card sorting for your navigation, show us that work by including a picture!]

Example:

### Wireframes

[Insert your wireframes here.]

## Milestone 2, Part III: Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Abby/Patricia/Patrick/Tim]** as my persona.

I've selected my persona because... [Tell us why you picked your persona in 1-3 sentences. Your explanation should include why your persona will help you address gender-inclusiveness bugs in your design.]

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 3 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: [describe your task]

  1. [action 1...]
  2. [action 2...]
  3. ...

Task 2:

Task 3:

### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.]

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

[copy the GenderMag template here and conduct a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate your design (wireframes).]

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough


#### Task 3 - Cognitive Walkthrough


### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

## Milestone 2, Part IV: Database Plan

### Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

### Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

## Milestone 2, Part V: Structure and Pseudocode

### Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - main page.
* includes/init.php - stuff that useful for every web page.
* TODO

### Pseudocode

[For each PHP file, plan out your pseudocode. You probably want a subheading for each file.]

#### index.php

```
Pseudocode for index.php...

include init.php

TODO
```

#### includes/init.php

```
messages = array to store messages for user (you may remove this)

// DB helper functions (you do not need to write this out since they are provided.)

db = connect to db

...

```

## Milestone 2, Part VI: Additional Comments

[Add any additional comments you have here.]


## Milestone 3: Updates

[If you make any changes to your plan or design, make a list of the changes here.]


## Milestone 4: Updates

[If you make any changes to your plan or design based on your peers' feedback, make a list of the changes here.]


## Milestone 5: Cognitive Walkthrough

[Copy your tasks here from Milestone 2. Update them if you need to and then conduct another cognitive walkthrough.]

### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Clients

[Describe in some detail what the client will do (or would have to do) in order to make this website go live. What is the deployment plan?]

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]

# Project 4 - Design & Plan

Your Team Name: Green Lion

## Milestone 1, Part II: Client Selection

### Client Description

[Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?]

[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the final project requirements.]

## Milestone 1, Part III: Client Requirements

   What kind of website do you want? What are your key goals?
       This website tells our customer or potential customer who we are and what our products can do. It also serve as an information center that user can find technical documents to help them use our products, and exchange ideas with engineers of our company and other users.

  Tell us about the potential audience for this website. How, when, and where would they interact with the website?
      The users are engineer and marketing person. The most place they interact with the website would be the blog section.

  Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about
      The purpose of the website is to tell people who we are and what we do.

### Target Audience(s)

The users are engineer and marketing person. The most place they interact with the website would be the blog section.


### Purpose & Content

The purpose of the website is to tell people who we are and what we do.

### Needs and Wants

This website tells our customer or potential customer who we are and what our products can do. It also serve as an information center that user can find technical documents to help them use our products, and exchange ideas with engineers of our company and other users.

* Needs/Wants 
  * **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    * Search bar for techincal documents
    * Information center
    * Exchange ideas with engineers and other users
  * **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    * Chinese version of this website
    * Use google translate to auto-translate the site
  * **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    * Creating multiple pages manually would require manual skills, effort and time that we do not have.

### Hosting Plan


[What is your plan for hosting your client's website?]

We will host the website on Heroku.

### Client's Edits

[Does the client need the ability to edit the site after the end of the semester? If **Yes**, tell us how you site fit your client's need. If **No**, write down N/A.]
**Yes** they will edit the site, we will send them our files so they can edit the code and content themselves.

### Information Architecture, Content, and Navigation

[Lay out the plan for how you'll organize the site and which content will go where. Note any content (e.g., text, image) that you need to make/get from the client.]

[Note: As with the Needs and Wants table, there is no specific amount to write here. You simply need enough content to do the job.]

Example:
* Content #1
  * **Main Navigation** (List your site's navigation here.)
    * Home
  * **Sub-Categories** (List any sub-categories of under the main navigation.)
    * Products
    * Applications
    * Blogs
    * Contact
  * **Content** (List all the content corresponding to main navigation and sub-categories.)
    * *Home*: Intro to company and company profile
    * *Products*: Description of their products which are computer chips
    * *Application*: Instruction for how to use your product
    * *Blogs*: Log in/ Log out to comment and add blog entries, list of all blog entries
    * *Contact*: Form for contact, other contact information

### Interactivity
* Log in and Log out to upload a blog and to comment.
* Commenting
* Send in contact form

Target audience wants to see reviews for products; log in and log out gives credibility to the source of the reviewers
Audience can use contact form to ask questions

### External Code

* Cookie
* Javascript

Cookies will only be used for 3-5% of the project. The rest will be our own code.

### Scale

6 pages, 10 hours per page.

## Milestone 2, Part I: PHP Interactivity

[Describe here what you plan to do for your PHP Interactivity requirement.]

## Milestone 2, Part II: Sketches, Navigation & Wireframes

### Sketches

[Insert your sketches here.]

### Navigation

[What will be your top-level pages and your sub-pages for those top-level pages? What will your website's navigational structure?]

[Tip: If you use card sorting for your navigation, show us that work by including a picture!]

Example:
* Products (top-level)
  * Shoes (sub-page)
  * Pants
  * Shirts
* Shopping Cart
* Contact

### Wireframes

[Insert your wireframes here.]

## Milestone 2, Part III: Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Abby/Patricia/Patrick/Tim]** as my persona.

I've selected my persona because... [Tell us why you picked your persona in 1-3 sentences. Your explanation should include why your persona will help you address gender-inclusiveness bugs in your design.]

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 3 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: [describe your task]

  1. [action 1...]
  2. [action 2...]
  3. ...

Task 2:

Task 3:

### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.]

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

[copy the GenderMag template here and conduct a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate your design (wireframes).]

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough


#### Task 3 - Cognitive Walkthrough


### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

## Milestone 2, Part IV: Database Plan

### Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

Table: movies
* field 1: description...
* field...

### Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

## Milestone 2, Part V: Structure and Pseudocode

### Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - main page.
* includes/init.php - stuff that useful for every web page.
* TODO

### Pseudocode

[For each PHP file, plan out your pseudocode. You probably want a subheading for each file.]

#### index.php

```
Pseudocode for index.php...

include init.php

TODO
```

#### includes/init.php

```
messages = array to store messages for user (you may remove this)

// DB helper functions (you do not need to write this out since they are provided.)

db = connect to db

...

```

## Milestone 2, Part VI: Additional Comments

## Milestone 5: Cognitive Walkthrough

[Copy your tasks here from Milestone 2. Update them if you need to and then conduct another cognitive walkthrough.]

### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Clients

[Describe in some detail what the client will do (or would have to do) in order to make this website go live. What is the deployment plan?]

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]
